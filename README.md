### Useful resources

-   [Use SASS in React.js](https://medium.com/how-to-react/use-sass-in-react-js-bbeb0b94f8a6) - Helped to understand the process of adding SASS to a React project using node-sass.

-   [A Complete Guide to CSS Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand breakpoints and how to handle HTML elements on a much smaller screen using CSS media queries.
